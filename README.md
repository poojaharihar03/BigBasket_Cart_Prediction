# BigBasket_Cart_Prediction
This repository contains a project that focuses on uncovering hidden insights within datasets through association rule mining using the Apriori algorithm and sequential pattern mining techniques.

In the era of data-driven decision-making, understanding the relationships and patterns within large datasets is crucial. This project delves into applying the Apriori algorithm and sequential pattern mining to extract valuable insights from transactional data. By identifying frequent itemsets and sequential patterns, we aim to uncover hidden associations and trends that can inform business strategies and decision-making processes.
